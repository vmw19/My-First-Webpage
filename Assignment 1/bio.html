            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p> Greetings! I am Victoria and I absolutely love <b>challenges</b>. I am a veteran elementary education teacher with over <i>12 years</i> of classroom experience.  I love learning and I enjoy teaching students, especially students with <del>special needs</del> exceptionalities. My first intrduction to coding was in the classroom. My students with behavior plans would always ask if they could code after comppleting their work! Coding really <strong> motivated</strong> my students in the classroom! Coding allowed my students with so many <em>challenges and difference</em>s to identify their <mark>strengths.</mark> </p>
            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p> My educational background includes a bachelor's degree in elementary education from the University of North Florida. I also earned a Master's degree in Legal Risk Managment and Human Resource Compliance from Florida State Univerity. I continued <sub>forward</sub> working on my doctorate degree, completing <small>only</small> four courses at the University of  <ins>West</ins> Florida. I decided to transfer colleges as the program of interest Vunerable and Marginalized Groups did not open. I am in the process of transferring to the University of Miami to earned a doctorate degree in Learning Sciences. <sup> Again,</sup>, I absolutely love learning as well as teaching. </p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Before the pandemic, I was a Fitbit <i>fanatic</i>. I enjoyed walking and exercising as well as competing virtually for walking badges. My <bold>highest badge</bold> for the number of steps I walked in one day was <del>450,000</del> 45,000 which is the Snow Boot badge. The next badges I would like are the Cowboy Boots, Platform Shoes, and Blue Suede Shoes badge.</p>
